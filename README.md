# Web Application Workshop
Welcome to the WiCS Web Application workshop! We'll be going through basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript so that you'll be able to to code your own working Tic Tac Toe web app.

# Adding functionality to tic-tac-toe.js
1.  Download the starter files using the links to the right.
2.  You're given the function (.check) that determines whether a Board is currently in a winning, losing, or draw state. This function should be called after each turn.
3.  Change the callback function (.handleClick) so that the correct letter (an X or an O) is drawn in the clicked cell. Also change the status box to a helpful message.
4.  Add a function that pops up the appropriate alert depending on whether the player has lost or won or if the game was a tie.  Call the function in the .check function.
5.  Write a function called .clearBoard that sets all of the board's cells to empty.  Call the function at the end of the game.
6.  Create a button that allows you to restart the game and calles .clearBoard.
